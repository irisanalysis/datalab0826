# Backend Startup Architecture Analysis

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Microservices Structure
```
API Gateway (8000) -> Entry Point
├── Data Service (8001)
├── AI Service (8002)  
├── Compute Service (8003)
├── Viz Service (8004)

### Current dev_server.py Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Unified service management
- Environment configuration loading
- Concurrent service startup
- Service registry management
- Health check integration
- UV package manager integration

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Threading model for service isolation
- Error handling and recovery
- Service dependency management
- Resource monitoring
- Graceful shutdown

## Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Enhanced Development Server

Key improvements needed:
- Process-based isolation instead of threads
- Service dependency ordering
- Better error handling and recovery
- Resource monitoring
- Hot-reload configuration

### 2. Production Deployment Strategy

Recommended approach:
- Docker containers per service
- Kubernetes/Docker Compose orchestration
- Health checks and monitoring
- Load balancing and scaling
- Circuit breaker patterns

### 3. UV Integration Best Practices

```bash
# Development commands
uv run python dev_server.py                    # All services
uv run python dev_server.py api_gateway        # Single service  
uv run uvicorn apps.api_gateway.main:app --reload --port 8000  # Direct uvicorn

# Production commands
uv run uvicorn apps.api_gateway.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

## Architecture Recommendations

### Development Environment
- Keep dev_server.py for unified development experience
- Add service dependency management
- Implement better health checks
- Add performance monitoring

### Production Environment  
- Use direct uvicorn with process managers
- Container-based deployment
- Load balancers for scaling
- Monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Enhance error handling in dev_server.py
2. **Short-term**: Add service dependency management
3. **Medium-term**: Implement production deployment configs
4. **Long-term**: Full observability and monitoring stack
